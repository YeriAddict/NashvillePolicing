    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe data we are interested in originates from The Stanford Open Policing Project found here. This project aims to compile diverse information concerning police stops and crimes across multiple cities in the USA. It is lead by a group of researchers and journalists at Stanford University and they gather records from law enforcement agencies. Each city possesses its own CSV file with distinct data columns, as policies may vary due to differing state or city laws. For a comprehensive description of the various column types within the datasets, this README provides an exhaustive overview of the data. Each row in the datasets represents a stop that occured in a particular city.\nWe have decided to choose the dataset for Nashville (Tennessee) because it has the largest number of columns amongst all the datasets while having a significant number of stops at the same time. This will give us more flexibility for a deeper analysis and to provide well-thought-out answers to our questions.\nThe initial dataset has:\n\nRows: 3092351\nColumns: 42\nData timeframe: 2010 to 2019\nFile size: 100 MB\nFile type: rds file\n\nThe table below provides a description of all columns, including their type and meaning, accompanied by an example:\n\n\nTable 2.1: Columns description for Nashville (TN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nType\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nraw_row_number\nnumeric\nRow number used to join clean data back to raw data\n3092350\n\n\ndate\nstring\nDate in “YYYY-MM-DD” format\n2016-09-09\n\n\ntime\nstring\nTime in “HH:MM:SS” format\n21:57:00\n\n\nlocation\nstring\nAddress in “Street, City, State, Zipcode”\nI 40 W & CHARLOTTE AVE, NASHVILLE, TN, 37203\n\n\nlat\nnumeric\nLatitude\n36.063321\n\n\nlng\nnumeric\nLongitude\n-86.637409\n\n\nprecinct\nnumeric\nPolice precinct\n2.0\n\n\nreporting_area\nPolice reporting area\n1863.0\n\n\n\nzone\nnumeric\nPolice zone\n223.0\n\n\nsubject_age\nnumeric\nAge of the stopped subject\n18.0\n\n\nsubject_race\nstring\nRace of the stopped subject\nhispanic\n\n\nsubject_sex\nstring\nSex of the stopped subject\nfemale\n\n\nofficer_id_hash\nstring\nUnique officer ID hash\ne7099bc91c\n\n\ntype\nType of stop: vehicular or pedestrian\nvehicular\n\n\n\nviolation\nstring\nSpecific violation of stop\nvehicle equipment violation\n\n\narrest_made\nbool\nIndicates whether an arrest was made\nFalse\n\n\ncitation_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a citation was issued\nFalse\n\n\nwarning_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a warning was issued\nFalse\n\n\noutcome\nstring\nIndicates whether one of these actions have been taken (arrest, citation, warning and summons)\ncitation\n\n\ncontraband_found\nbool\nIndicates whether a contraband was found\nFalse\n\n\ncontraband_drugs\nbool\nIndicates whether drugs were found\nFalse\n\n\ncontraband_weapons\nbool\nIndicates whether weapons were found\nFalse\n\n\nfrisk_performed\nbool\nIndicates whether a frisk was performed\nFalse\n\n\nsearch_conducted\nbool\nIndicates whether a search was conducted\nFalse\n\n\nsearch_person\nbool\nIndicates whether a person was searched\nFalse\n\n\nsearch_vehicle\nbool\nIndicates whether a vehicle was searched\nFalse\n\n\nsearch_basis\nstring\nProvides the reason for the search (k9, consent, plain view, probable cause, other)\nconsent\n\n\nreason_for_stop\nstring\nProvides the reason for the stop\nmoving traffic violation\n\n\nvehicle_registration_state\nstring\nVehicle state origin (ex: TN for Tennessee)\nTN\n\n\nnotes\nstring\nContains officer notes\nCITED FOR NOT HAVING INSURANCE\n\n\nraw_verbal_warning_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a verbal warning was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_written_warning_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a written warning was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_traffic_citation_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a traffic citation was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_misd_state_citation_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a misd state citation was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_suspect_ethnicity\nstring\nEthnicity of the suspect\nH\n\n\nraw_driver_searched\nbool\nIndicates whether a driver was searched\nFalse\n\n\nraw_passenger_searched\nbool\nIndicates whether a passenger was searched\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_consent\nbool\nIndicates whether a search was consent\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_arrest\nbool\nIndicates whether a search was due to an arrest\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_warrant\nbool\nIndicates whether a search warrant was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_inventory\nbool\nIndicates whether an inventory search\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_plain_view\nbool\nIndicates whether evidence was seized without a warrant\nFalse\n\n\n\n\nSee Table 2.1.\nThe data file has been downloaded locally and is available inside the repository as it is not too heavy. Furthermore, there are some noticeable patterns regarding N/A values that we should deal with by subsetting our data. For instance, some columns sometimes have a vast majority of those values. Also, we noticed that the last year (2019) was not complete and only has 14235 stops. These are issues that need to be taken care of."
