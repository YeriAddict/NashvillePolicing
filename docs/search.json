    "text": "1 Introduction\nMost drivers in America are familiar with the situation of getting pulled over while on the road. The reasons can be anything from speeding to a having a broken tail light, which are obvious examples of law-breaking. However, one might wonder if there is more to the story. For this project, we use data from policing records in Nashville provided by the Stanford Computational Journalism Lab, the Knight Foundation, and the Stanford Computational Policy Lab.\nWe are interested in how different features of the traffic stop are related to one another, including its temporal aspect, its geographic location, and the demographic data of the driver. It may be interesting to see if more people are stopped during a certain time of day (such as rush hour) or at a busy location (such as a large intersection). Maybe there is a distinction between the brand of car driven or the age of the vehicle. Additionally, there are certain stereotypes about race and driving that may also be evident. Are Asians really the worst drivers? Are male drivers more reckless? These are among the questions that we plan to investigate through exploration of our data."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe data we are interested in originates from The Stanford Open Policing Project found here. This project aims to compile diverse information concerning police stops and crimes across multiple cities in the USA. The project is lead by a group of researchers and journalists at Stanford University and the data is requested from law enforcement agencies. Each city possesses its own CSV/Rdata file with distinct data columns, as policies may vary due to differing state or city laws. For a comprehensive description of the various column types within the datasets, this README provides an exhaustive overview of the data. Each row in the dataset represents a stop that occurred in a particular city.\nWe have decided to choose the dataset for Nashville (Tennessee) because it has the most comprehensive features among all of the cities while also having a significant number of stops. This will give us more flexibility for a deeper analysis and to provide well-thought-out answers to our questions.\nThe initial dataset has:\n\nRows: 3092351\nColumns: 42\nData timeframe: 2010 to 2019\nFile size: 100 MB\nFile type: rds file\n\nThe table below provides a description of all columns, including their type and meaning, accompanied by an example:\n\n\nTable 2.1: Columns description for Nashville (TN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nType\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nraw_row_number\nnumeric\nRow number used to join clean data back to raw data\n3092350\n\n\ndate\nstring\nDate in “YYYY-MM-DD” format\n2016-09-09\n\n\ntime\nstring\nTime in “HH:MM:SS” format\n21:57:00\n\n\nlocation\nstring\nAddress in “Street, City, State, Zipcode”\nI 40 W & CHARLOTTE AVE, NASHVILLE, TN, 37203\n\n\nlat\nnumeric\nLatitude\n36.063321\n\n\nlng\nnumeric\nLongitude\n-86.637409\n\n\nprecinct\nnumeric\nPolice precinct\n2.0\n\n\nreporting_area\nnumeric\nPolice reporting area\n1863.0\n\n\nzone\nnumeric\nPolice zone\n223.0\n\n\nsubject_age\nnumeric\nAge of the stopped subject\n18.0\n\n\nsubject_race\nstring\nRace of the stopped subject\nhispanic\n\n\nsubject_sex\nstring\nSex of the stopped subject\nfemale\n\n\nofficer_id_hash\nstring\nUnique officer ID hash\ne7099bc91c\n\n\ntype\nstring\nType of stop: vehicular or pedestrian\nvehicular\n\n\nviolation\nstring\nSpecific violation of stop\nvehicle equipment violation\n\n\narrest_made\nbool\nIndicates whether an arrest was made\nFalse\n\n\ncitation_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a citation was issued\nFalse\n\n\nwarning_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a warning was issued\nFalse\n\n\noutcome\nstring\nIndicates whether one of these actions have been taken (arrest, citation, warning and summons)\ncitation\n\n\ncontraband_found\nbool\nIndicates whether a contraband was found\nFalse\n\n\ncontraband_drugs\nbool\nIndicates whether drugs were found\nFalse\n\n\ncontraband_weapons\nbool\nIndicates whether weapons were found\nFalse\n\n\nfrisk_performed\nbool\nIndicates whether a frisk was performed\nFalse\n\n\nsearch_conducted\nbool\nIndicates whether a search was conducted\nFalse\n\n\nsearch_person\nbool\nIndicates whether a person was searched\nFalse\n\n\nsearch_vehicle\nbool\nIndicates whether a vehicle was searched\nFalse\n\n\nsearch_basis\nstring\nProvides the reason for the search (k9, consent, plain view, probable cause, other)\nconsent\n\n\nreason_for_stop\nstring\nProvides the reason for the stop\nmoving traffic violation\n\n\nvehicle_registration_state\nstring\nVehicle state origin (ex: TN for Tennessee)\nTN\n\n\nnotes\nstring\nContains officer notes\nCITED FOR NOT HAVING INSURANCE\n\n\nraw_verbal_warning_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a verbal warning was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_written_warning_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a written warning was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_traffic_citation_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a traffic citation was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_misd_state_citation_issued\nbool\nIndicates whether a misd state citation was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_suspect_ethnicity\nstring\nEthnicity of the suspect\nH\n\n\nraw_driver_searched\nbool\nIndicates whether a driver was searched\nFalse\n\n\nraw_passenger_searched\nbool\nIndicates whether a passenger was searched\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_consent\nbool\nIndicates whether a search was consent\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_arrest\nbool\nIndicates whether a search was due to an arrest\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_warrant\nbool\nIndicates whether a search warrant was issued\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_inventory\nbool\nIndicates whether an inventory search\nFalse\n\n\nraw_search_plain_view\nbool\nIndicates whether evidence was seized without a warrant\nFalse\n\n\n\n\nSee Table 2.1.\nThe data file has been downloaded locally and is available inside the repository as it is not too large.

Our subsetted data includes only data from 2012-2016."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nStudying trends in Nashville traffic stops provides insights into the bigger picture of law enforcement and social dynamics. One can consider any of the many factors that contribute to why someone is stopped to understand policing strategy more. The type of car someone drives may be more scrutinized by an officer, and this may differ according to time of day or day of wekk. Analyzing the intersection of race, gender, and age among those stopped can shed light on potential underlying biases in policing. Through our dive on the policing patterns in Nashville, we hope to tell a more transparent story of the law enforcement system.\nWe plan to touch on several research areas using our data:\n\nTo what extent do spatiotemporal factors play a part in traffic stops? This includes features like geographic location and time of day.\nWhat are the demographic patterns of those stopped? Are those of a certain gender, age, or race overrepresented in their number of traffic stops?\nWhat do the outcomes of traffic stops look like? To answer this we will look at if the suspect was searched, if a ticket was issued, etc.\nAre there patterns in the types of cars that are stopped?"

We see that there are four columns (search_basis, contraband_weapons, contraband_found, notes) with a very high percentage of missing values (&gt;75%).

We see that in 2017-2019, there is no data for raw_written_warning_issued, and from 2010-2011 the column raw_misd_state_citation_issued is mostly empty.\nSince the years 2012-2016 have the cleanest data in general, we decided to subset these years for our research going forward."
